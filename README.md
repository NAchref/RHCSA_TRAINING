The RHCSA exam was recently updated for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. This book 
contains all you need to know to pass the RHCSA exam. As you will see, this Cert 
Guide covers every objective in the exam


On the RHCSA exam, you do not need to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
However, because you need to install an environment that allows you to test all 
items discussed in this repositories, you start by installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux in this 
chapter. This chapter describes all steps that you will encounter while performing 
an installation of RHEL 8.

Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux contains registered trademarks, I will use 
CentOS to show you the installation. The only thing that is different in CentOS is 
the branding, which in CentOS is free to use. All software in CentOS is the same as 
the software in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Because CentOS does not contain any 
registered trademarks, it is a common and popular solution that enables people to 
learn how to work with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 


What Is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Server?

RHEL 8 is a Linux distribution. As you probably know, Linux is a free operating 
system. That means that the source code of all programs is available for free.


However, some enterprise Linux distributions are sold as commercial products, with 
bundled support and maintenance, which is the case for RHEL 8; free downloads 
of RHEL 8 are restricted. There is a 60-day evaluation version available, and 
alternatively you can register for a free Red Hat developer subscription at 
https://developers.redhat.com.
