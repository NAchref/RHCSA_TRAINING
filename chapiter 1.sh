Linux distribution closely related to Red Hat Enterprise Linux is Fedora, 
a completely open source Linux distribution that is available for free.

Red Hat has a lot of staff dedicated to contributing to the Fedora project, because Red Hat uses 
Fedora as the development platform for RHEL.

Important ! :
which is why you should 
not use Fedora to prepare for the RCHSA exam

Fedora is also used by Red Hat as a testing ground for new features that might or might not be included in future 
RHEL releases. If you were to choose Fedora, you would be working with items 
that are not available in RHEL, which means that you would have to do things differently on the exam. So, donâ€™t use it
